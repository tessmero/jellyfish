Jellyfish swim around randomly. Click or touch to manually control the jellyfish.

Floaty ribbon-like smoke-like tentacles are animated with fast approximate physics. They are non-procedural, meaning that we keep track of every particle's position and velocity between frames. (As apposed to [warp](https://github.com/tessmero/warp) which procedural, meaning that the particle's positions are generated as they are drawn)
